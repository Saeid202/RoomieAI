              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                RoomieMatch was founded in 2023 by a group of friends who experienced firsthand the challenges of 
                finding compatible roommates in urban areas. After several disappointing experiences with random 
                roommate matches, they decided there had to be a better way. Combining expertise in AI, psychology, 
                and real estate, they developed a sophisticated matching algorithm that considers lifestyle habits, 
                financial compatibility, and personal preferences to create harmonious living situations.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                As the platform evolved, we expanded our services to include co-investment matching, helping people 
                pool their resources to enter the property market when individual purchasing power might be limited.
