# Roommate Hook Error Fix - Summary

## Problem
The rental application page was showing a console error:
```
Error loading profile data: Error: Failed to fetch profile: relation "public.roommate" does not exist
```

## Root Cause
The `useRoommateProfile` hook was being called somewhere in the application (likely through `useRoommateMatching` or `RoommateRecommendations` component), and it was directly querying the `roommate` table without handling the case where the table doesn't exist.

## Solution
**Modified `src/hooks/useRoommateProfile.ts`** to gracefully handle the "table not found" error (PostgreSQL error code `42P01`).

### What Changed:
- Added error handling for PostgreSQL error code `42P01` (relation does not exist)
- When the roommate table doesn't exist, the hook now:
  - Logs a warning message instead of throwing an error
  - Falls back to using default profile data
  - Continues execution without breaking the UI

### Code Change:
```typescript
// Before: Would throw error and break the app
if (fetchError && fetchError.code !== 'PGRST116') {
  console.error("Error fetching roommate profile:", fetchError);
  throw new Error(`Failed to fetch profile: ${fetchError.message}`);
}

// After: Gracefully handles missing table
if (fetchError && fetchError.code === '42P01') {
  console.warn("Roommate table does not exist yet. Using default profile data.");
  setProfileData(getDefaultProfileData());
  hasCompleted = true;
  return;
}

if (fetchError && fetchError.code !== 'PGRST116') {
  console.error("Error fetching roommate profile:", fetchError);
  throw new Error(`Failed to fetch profile: ${fetchError.message}`);
}
```

## Why This is Better Than Creating the Table
1. **No unnecessary database tables** - We don't need the roommate table if it's not being used for the rental application
2. **Defensive programming** - The hook now handles missing tables gracefully
3. **Future-proof** - If the table is created later, the hook will automatically start using it
4. **No database changes required** - Fix is purely in the application code

## Testing
1. Refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5)
2. Navigate to the rental application page
3. Check the browser console - the error should be replaced with a warning message
4. The rental application should function normally

## Next Steps (Optional)
If you want to use roommate matching features in the future:
1. Run the appropriate SQL migration to create the `roommate` table
2. The hook will automatically detect it and start using it
3. No code changes needed!
