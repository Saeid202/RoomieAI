## üîÑ Workflow Process

3. Form submission creates contract with `status: 'pending_landlord_signature'`
4. System creates notification for landlord
5. Tenant sees "Contract sent to landlord for signature" message

### Step 2: Landlord Reviews Contract
1. Landlord receives notification in dashboard
2. Landlord clicks "View Contracts" button
3. Landlord sees contract details and tenant signature status
4. Contract is frozen (read-only) after tenant signs

### Step 3: Landlord Signs Contract
1. Landlord reviews all contract terms
2. Landlord checks "I agree to sign this lease contract" checkbox
3. Landlord clicks "Sign Contract" button
4. Contract status updates to `fully_signed`
5. System creates notification for tenant

### Step 4: Contract Fully Executed
1. Tenant receives "Contract Fully Executed" notification
2. Both parties can view the completed contract
3. Contract appears in "Active Contracts" section
